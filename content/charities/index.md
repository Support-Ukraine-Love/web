  List of charities serving Ukraine.

There are two large sections that follow. The first is the "quick
reference" for anyone that would like to know our top recommendations.
The second has incredibly detailed information about a variety of
charities, orgs, etc. that offer assistance. This information is sourced
from the [same doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w59p4ar7wwrZCV8c9PeUIJPGFA53jUcFaJhJCCM5Fik/edit#heading=h.6vjc4ayajjr3)
that is a reference for this site's [refugee](../refugee) page that is being 
built by a group of disaster relief workers.

If you would like the 411 on how to verify a charity or org that
you already have in mind, please take a look at the
[Charity Verification](#charity-verification) section.

The Ministry of Social Policy will channel the raised funds to support Ukraine‚Äôs citizens severely affected by the war."
* "Money transferred to this account will be used by the [Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine](https://www.msp.gov.ua/en/):
    * to provide food and shelter for refugees and citizens that have been displaced due to military conflict;
    * to provide clothing, shoes, and medicine for them;
    * to buy staple goods for the population;
    * to pay out one-off financial aid and to meet other essential needs of the population."
* [CNBC | Here‚Äôs a list of the top-rated charities to help the Ukraine relief effort](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/heres-a-list-of-top-rated-charities-to-help-the-ukraine-relief-effort.html): "To make sure your money gets into the right hands, here is a list of highly rated nonprofits engaged in relief and recovery efforts in Ukraine and the surrounding areas."

### Charity Verification

* On the [I.R.S. website](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/tax-exempt-organization-search), you can search to see if your organization is listed as a 501(c)3. Make sure the charity is an actual charity. (To claim your donation as a deduction, the organization must have this status.)
* [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/): When choosing a charity, look for one that spends less than 30% of its total costs on administration and fundraising expenses. 
* [Guidestar.org](https://www.guidestar.org/): You can learn more about the charity and their rating. A good rule of thumb is to stick with charities with a rating of 3 stars and above. 
* You can review complaints about charities at [Give.org](https://give.org/), the BBB Wise Giving Alliance.
* Search the charity register for the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information). *There are different registers for charities in [Scotland](https://www.oscr.org.uk/search) and charities in [Northern Ireland](https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/?pageNumber=1).
* We recommend that you check out the social pages of organizations you are thinking of donating to. Many smaller orgs post _how_ _they are using donations_ and provide some element of verification. Transparency is paramount.

This page is dedicated for those of us who are watching what is
happening in Ukraine and trying to figure out to help.

There are several types of resources available on this site. The main
[Resources](resources) has information that can help people reach out to
their governments - who to call, what to ask for that would be
helfpul, as well as general information about the structure of how
individual country governments interface with each other.

Charities that are currently giving aid directly to real time are
also listed. Note that these are mostly local charities as large,
international charities are subject to beaurocratic delays and
getting resources to people is incredibly time-sensitive.

For those that are tech aware, there are also a series of related
resources and information under OSINT. This will allow you take
part in various tech initiatives and software projects that are
supporting Ukraine.

And lastly, information. There is a lot information going around
with varying degrees of accuracy. Some of this is due to the rapid
pace of the news cycle, but some of this is intentional
disinformation. We're compiling a list of known sources of
reliable information as well as sources to avoid.

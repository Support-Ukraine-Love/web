This page is dedicated to those of us who wish to help
Ukraine by providing information and resources. These are
split into a few categories (also seen on the left nav menu):

* [Charities](charities)
* [Information & Disinformation](information)
* [OSINT](osint) (Open Source Intelligence)
* [Template Letters](templates)
* [What's Happening](whats-happening)
* [Contact Us](contact)

#### Breakdown of what each of these are

[Charities](charities) that are currently giving aid directly to
Ukraine. The charities listed here are local charities as large,
international charities are subject to beaurocratic delays and
getting resources to people is incredibly time-sensitive.

[Information and Disinformation](information) is two primary lists:
sites known to provide accurate information and a list of sources to
avoid that are known propoganda / spreading deliberately false
information. There is also a third list of sites to use with caution.

[OSINT](osint), or Open Source Intelligence, provides resources
specific to technology. These include relevant software projects
and tech initiatives.

[Template Letters](templates) are for those interested in reaching out
to elected officials. These are split out by geographic region / 
government.

[What's Happening](whats-happening) is the generic title chosen for
topics that are effectively a speed course through the various
governments, councils, names of representatives, and so forth and
how they relate to each other. (Currently being drafted.)

[Contact Us](contact) is how to reach out to help maintain this
site or to send us updated information, PRs, etc. This page also
lists specific information we're currently reaching out for
assistance with.

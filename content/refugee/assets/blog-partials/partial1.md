### Useful Information On Warfare



* "**What can I do if there is fighting?**

    (*This advice is in regard to shelling/ missile strikes, etc. There is separate advice in relation to chemical & nuclear weapons attacks.)

1. If there's a basement, immediately, go there. Stay in a safe zone on lower ground with protective walls.
2. Stay as far as possible from windows.
3. Wait until the shooting is over before you move to a safer shelter.
4. Don't pick up anything you haven't dropped yourself. During conflict, things that may look harmless could potentially be explosive objects. Stay away from unattended objects that do not belong to you." [Source](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/europe-central-asia/ukraine/help-useful-information-affected-people)
5. "If you are trapped in debris, use a flashlight, whistle or tap on pipes to signal your location to rescuers.
6. Shout only as a last resort to avoid inhaling dangerous dust.
7. Cover your nose and mouth with anything you have on hand." [Source](https://www.ready.gov/explosions)
* Be careful of [mines](https://www.facebook.com/100505105900087/posts/121511370466127/) — warn children that they may look like colorful toys!

    **Remember: "If _you_ didn't drop it; _don't_ pick it up!"** [Video](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid034JomvpmFqoKikUEACksUgd5Tj3zvbAYT3D1KKEhV7XDRDfDzhwqikfcXtgrVbbyMl&id=353667671424634&m_entstream_source=timeline&__tn__=%2As%2As-R).

* [What to Know About **White Phosphorus Bombs**](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/white-phosphorus-bombs-overview) — "It’s a chemical made from phosphate rocks. In solid form, it has a waxy texture and a garlic-like odor. It may be white or yellow in color, or clear (colorless)." _It ignites upon contact with oxygen._

    "White phosphorus is highly soluble in fat and therefore deeply burns human flesh. If fragments of white phosphorus enter the bloodstream, they can lead to multiple organ failure. Already-dressed wounds can reignite when dressings are removed, and they are re-exposed to oxygen." [Source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/17/qa-incendiary-weapons-ukraine#Five)


    [First Aid & Decontamination](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750025.html): "Initial treatment is primarily supportive. In cases of skin or eye exposure, immediately remove burning particles of white phosphorus from the patient/victim’s eyes or skin. If skin or eyes are contaminated with white phosphorus, cover them with cool wet cloths to avoid re-ignition.

    * ⚠️ There is _no antidote_ for white phosphorus toxicity. ⚠️

    2. Walk away from the site and into a building in order to shelter-in-place. Do not run.
    3. Bring family and pets inside. 
    4. Lock doors, close windows, air vents, and fireplace dampers. 
    5. Turn off fans, air conditioning, and forced air heating systems. 
    6. Go into a room with as few windows as possible. Seal the room to create a temporary barrier between people and the contaminated air outside. [_NOT THE BASEMENT_]
    7. Seal all windows, doors, and air vents with plastic sheeting and duct tape. 
    8. Improvise with what is on hand to seal gaps to create a barrier from any contamination. 
    9. Watch TV, listen to the radio, or check the Internet often for official news and instructions as they become available."

* "In case of evacuation during a chemical attack:

    1. take a first aid kit;
    2. dress so that there is as little exposed skin as possible;
    3. use gas masks or cotton gauze bandages soaked in water or preferably 2-5% solution of baking soda (for chlorine), acetic or citric acid (for ammonia);
    4. leave the room by stairs;
    5. do not touch any objects on the street." [Source](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/03/24/7334047/)

    "Most [sarin](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750001.html) affects the nervous system, over-activating it, which is accompanied by a variety of symptoms." 

* **How does sarin get into the human body?**

     * The gas enters the human body through the skin, mucous membranes of the eyes and respiratory system.
     * Clothing contaminated with sarin is also a threat because it evaporates and poisons people around. 
     * Sarin is heavier than air, so the risk of sarin poisoning is higher in the lowlands, even higher - in the basement."
* **What to do — According to the [National Library of Medicine](https://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/substance?substanceId=151&identifier=Sarin&identifierType=name&menuItemId=61&catId=85):**
    * "If you wear glasses, wear them.
    * If the projectile with sarin exploded near the house, you need to immediately close the windows, doors, and close all vents [and fireplace dampers]. **_Never turn on the air conditioner._**
    * Do not go outside immediately after a chemical weapon attack, most poisons last for hours. It is necessary to wait for the notification that the chemical threat has passed, information about the ways of safe evacuation.
    * If an explosion occurs on the street, you must immediately leave the place, moving against the wind. You need to move quickly, but do not run, so as not to speed up breathing. It is desirable to hide in the nearest room, or at least in a car with raised windows.
    * If you have a chemical attack, you need to get rid of your clothes as soon as possible. Sarin on clothes evaporates and is dangerous. Clothes should not be removed over the head, it is better to cut and thus remove it.
    * After removing the clothes, you need to wash all areas of skin in contact with the poison with water, preferably also with soap. The more, the better.
    * Eyes should also be rinsed thoroughly with water for at least 10 minutes.
    * Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with sarin.
    * Artificial ventilation of the lungs, especially artificial respiration in this situation is unacceptable."
    * "If it is not possible to turn to specialists, then, according to cardiologist Daria Stepchina, if the enemy uses sarin, which is a neuro-paralytic, the best antidote is:
        * Diazepam
        * Anthropine"
    * "You should also use aqueous solutions of ammonia, alkalis, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxylamine solution in a slightly alkaline environment to disinfect surfaces, rooms, objects and even clothing."
    * "One antidote, [atropine](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00572), blocks acetylcholine receptors, sparing the body's muscles from overstimulation. The other, [pralidoxime](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00733), or 2-PAM, removes sarin from the enzyme that stops acetylcholine from accumulating, Nelson said. However, both antidotes must be given within about 10 minutes of exposure in order to be effective, he said." [Source](https://www.livescience.com/58593-facts-about-sarin.html)
* **[Nuclear Explosion](https://www.ready.gov/nuclear-explosion)** — "Nuclear devices range from a small portable device carried by an individual to a weapon carried by a missile.<br />
Fallout is most dangerous in the first few hours after the detonation when it is giving off the highest levels of radiation. It takes time for fallout to arrive back to ground level, often more than 15 minutes for areas outside of the immediate blast damage zones." Conceivably, this provides some time to react and protect yourself to at least some degree — learn what best to do in case of a potential emergency. 

* [CDC | Radiation Emergencies](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/nuclearfaq.htm)
    * **"How can I protect my family and myself during a nuclear blast?**
    * **If you are near the blast when it occurs:**
        * Turn away and close and cover your eyes to prevent damage to your sight.
        * Drop to the ground face down and place your hands under your body.
        * Remain flat until the heat and two shock waves have passed.

    * **If you are outside when the blast occurs:**

        * Find something to cover your mouth and nose, such as a scarf, handkerchief, or other cloth.
        * Remove any dust from your clothes by brushing, shaking, and wiping in a ventilated area, however, cover your mouth and nose while you do this.
        * Move to a shelter, basement, or other underground area, preferably located away from the direction that the wind is blowing.
        * Remove clothing since it may be contaminated; if possible, take a shower, wash your hair, and change clothes before you enter the shelter.
    * **If you are already in a shelter or basement:**
        * Cover your mouth and nose with a face mask or other material (such as a scarf or handkerchief) until the fallout cloud has passed.
        * Shut off ventilation systems and seal doors or windows until the fallout cloud has passed. However, after the fallout cloud has passed, unseal the doors and windows to allow some air circulation.
        * Stay inside until authorities say it is safe to come out.
        * Listen to the local radio or television for information and advice. Authorities may direct you to stay in your shelter or evacuate to a safer place away from the area.
        * If you must go out, cover your mouth and nose with a damp towel.
        * Use stored food and drinking water. Do not eat local fresh food or drink water from open water supplies.
        * Clean and cover any open wounds on your body."

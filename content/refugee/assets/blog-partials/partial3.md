Under such conditions, we can feel stress & deep feelings, fear, anxiety, both for ourselves and for loved ones. To safely adapt to modern realities, minimize the effects of stress, we offer you simple steps [see link]."

    _"Remember that it is normal to feel anxiety, worry and fear at a time when there is fighting around you and the country is at war with the aggressor._ _This is an acceptable reaction of your psyche and body to the situation."_

* "Svitlana Roiz and the [Ministry of Education and Science](https://mon.gov.ua/eng) have launched a video project ["Psychological Care"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLFVSJgZgf7h8rXg9TTyevxZkdfxAQXodS&fbclid=IwAR0qUXzXfGQbi3yYTI8D3pt1D_GxBc20O5sN7-f3C9K7N_nBpo) for children.

**[Grounding Exercises](https://niaendingviolence.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WGN-Gateway-Self-Help-Guide.pdf)** **— _I am feeling overwhelmed, what can I do?_** 



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">"Sensory grounding exercise 5,4,3,2,1</span>
    * Describe 5 things you can see in the room.
    * Name 4 things you can feel (“my feet  on the floor” or “the air in my nose”).
    * Name 3 things you hear right now  (“traffic outside”).
    * Name 2 things you can smell right  now (or 2 smells you like).
    * Name 1 good thing about yourself. 
    * You should feel calmer and more at ease  by the end of the exercise. 
    * Repeat the 5  steps more than once if needed. 
    * Try out  the technique in different situations. (I use this technique often. 💙💛 Jenn)
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Physical grounding technique</span>:
    * Place both feet flat on the floor.
    * Lean back into your chair, and make note  of the feeling of the chair under you and against your back.
    * Cross your arms over your chest.
    * Gently tap your shoulders, alternating  one side at a time.
    *  Alternatively, you can place your hands on your thighs if you are in public, tapping one leg at a time. Although not as effective as shoulder tapping, this technique can still calm you down.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use an object</span>:
    * Touch something that you enjoy the sensation of, a stone that is smooth, a crystal, a piece of wood – anything that feels solid and that you can use to remember where you are and that you are safe – you can carry this around with you all day and every time you feel nervous just throw your hands into your pocket to remember you are here and safe right now."

    * "There are two options when you cross the border into the European Union: 
        * You can move freely for up to 90 days on a standard tourist visa;
        * You can claim temporary protection for 1 year, which may be renewed for up to 3 years in total depending on the circumstances.
    * The Temporary Protection Directive gives you a series of rights, including access to housing, education, employment and self-employment, necessary assistance in terms of social welfare and means of subsistence, and medical care.
    * Please note that once you have claimed temporary protection in one Member State, you cannot normally claim it in another Member State. 
    * You should therefore only register for temporary protection when you have reached the country in which you want to stay for a longer period.  
    * We can advise you and put you in contact with organisations in different countries that can support you. 
    * In addition, please note that you can lose the benefit of temporary protection if you apply for asylum. The situation may depend on the rules in the Member States in which you are, so we advise you to seek legal advice if you wish to apply for asylum."

    * Agree with family or friends on a code word or phrase that will tell you that you are in danger.
    * If you are in danger, call the local emergency services and contact the Ukrainian embassy in the host country.

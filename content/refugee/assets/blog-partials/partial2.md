* "What should parents expect from their children while in the shelter? How should they support them?

    There should be books, games and computers there for children to use. But in a state of hyper-alertness, a lot of children find it difficult to concentrate or do anything apart from cry. If this happens, hold and comfort the child. Don’t tell them to stop being afraid. This isn’t helpful — it dismisses what they are feeling. Rather, acknowledge that it is a scary situation and reassure them that you are with them and things will be okay.


    Then after the alert has passed, go to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PmBYdfv5RSk) for breathing exercises, music, and movement exercises to “shake out the fear” and reduce levels of tension.

#### Pratical Guide for Wartime

[Practical Guide: In Case of Emergency or War](https://dovidka.info/en/) (website)

"It is important to know what each of us can do in an emergency,
especially true when the police, ambulance, rescue services, and
other services are forced to work in an emergency.
In this handbook, you will find practical advice on preparing for
an emergency and how to act in such a case."

#### What can I do if there is fighting?

* If there's a basement, immediately go there. Stay in a safe zone
on lower ground with protective walls.
* Stay as far as possible from windows.
* Wait until the shooting is over before you move to a safer
  shelter.
* Don't pick up anything you haven't dropped yourself. During
  conflict, things that may look harmless could potentially be
  explosive objects. Stay away from unattended objects that do not
  belong to you." Source
* "If you are trapped in debris, use a flashlight, whistle or tap
  on pipes to signal your location to rescuers.
* Shout only as a last resort to avoid inhaling dangerous dust.
* Cover your nose and mouth with anything you have on hand.

allows you to share your movements with contacts you choose. You can use this when you
travel or accept a ride from someone you don't know well.
**_Always_** let someone know where you are going and who you are with.

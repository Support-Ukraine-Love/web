    (*This advice is in regard to shelling/ missile strikes, etc. There is separate advice in relation to chemical & nuclear weapons attacks. See the '[Useful Information](#useful-information)' section. )

1. If there's a basement, immediately, go there. Stay in a safe zone on lower ground with protective walls.
2. Stay as far as possible from windows.
3. Wait until the shooting is over before you move to a safer shelter.
4. Don't pick up anything you haven't dropped yourself. During conflict, things that may look harmless could potentially be explosive objects. Stay away from unattended objects that do not belong to you." [Source](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/europe-central-asia/ukraine/help-useful-information-affected-people)
5. "If you are trapped in debris, use a flashlight, whistle or tap on pipes to signal your location to rescuers.

### Persons Inside Ukraine

The ICRC & UNHCR Advise:

* "Your personal documents: In a secure and protective bag keep a copy of your national identity card, passport, family certificates, birth certificate, insurance documents, property documents, etc.
* Make sure children know their personal information such as their full names, parents' names, and parents' contacts." [ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/europe-central-asia/ukraine/help-useful-information-affected-people)
* Stay informed and connected (via radio, TV, Internet) and follow official advice for your security. Listen to official messages from emergency services, local authorities, and follow the instructions, including regarding curfews.
* Keep a copy (even digital) of your documents in a safe place. The replacement of lost documents will be easier if people can present a copy to the SMS later. (*You can also take photos of them and email them to yourself - along with photos of your family and of yourself _with_ your pets.)
* For advice on how to provide emotional support to children during these difficult times, see pages such as [this](https://www.unhcr.org/mental-health-psychosocial-support.html)." [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/ua/en/42841-information-for-persons-under-unhcr-mandate.html)

If this happens, hold and comfort the child. Don’t tell them to stop being afraid. This isn’t helpful — it dismisses what they are feeling.

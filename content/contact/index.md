  How to help us keep this site updated.
---

## Succinctly

This site is hosted on GitHub and updates to the site directly are
made via pull request and tickets are managed via a GitHub repo.

## How to request changes

Please use our [Trello form](https://app.bluecatforms.com/q1Ga9mo3/new-form)
to let us know of errors on the site, request adding new
information, and/or offer to assist with site maintenance.

## Information we're specifically asking for

All new information is welcome, but we are looking for help with
some specific pieces as well:

* Template letters to government officials for governments besides
the United States (currently our only templated letter)
* Additional, non-global, charities providing emergency aid to
Ukraine
* Tech-based initiatives that we can add to our OSINT page.

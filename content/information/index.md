categorized by their primary method of delivery as some have
more than one.

### ☑️  "Grey Zone" ☑️

These are notable sites that have been known to post a mix
of correct and incorrect information, but they are
_not_ propoganda. Note that there are a _lot_ of sites that
probably fall in this category so we will not be tracking them
all, only the few we see appearing most often.

* [NEXTA](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv)<br />
  Belarusian Telegram channel and Twitter account.

## ⛔️ Distrusted Sources ⛔️

The following are **distrusted** sources of information, including
sources of direct propogata and intentional misinformation. To avoid
click-throughs, these links are displayed in plain-text so you can
recognize them.

### Common Sources of Misinformation / Propoganda

* TASS - sites from tass.com
* Ria - sites from ria.ru
* Russia Today - sites from rt.com<br />
  Note: A common abbreviation is "RT", not to be confused with
  "retweet" depending on context / platform.

## ⚠️  Caution ⚠️

The following websites are not necessarily confirmed sources of 
information or disinformation, but are providing services that
should be regarded with caution.

* Several news sources have reported on the site built by two
Harvard University students to match Ukranian refugees with
housing. As of 22 Mar 2022 the site does _not_ validate who is
posting these entries and there have been uncomfirmed reports of
misuse and reported as a risk of trafficking as a result.

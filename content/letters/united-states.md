Hi \<**<u>representative</u>**\> - my name is \<**<u>name</u>**\> and I am a voter in 
\<**<u>state / district</u>**\>. I am concerned about the escalating war in Eastern
Europe. Russia has been threatening Ukrainian sovereignty since
2014, but the conflict escalated to open war on
Feb 24, 2022. The Russian and the Belarusian militaries have also
been using prohibited weapons, such as cluster munitions and
thermobaric bombs.  Furthermore, this war wonâ€™t just be contained
to Ukraine, it also threatens both Europe as a whole and NATO -
especially Poland, the Baltic states, and nations in the Black Sea
region.

I am calling you today, asking you to support actions that will
secure and enforce freedom and democracy, as well as long term
peace in Europe. Specifically, I am asking for:

1. Immediate emergency military aid to Ukraine including air defense,
antitank, anti-ship, anti-aircraft, and electronic warfare
systems.
1. Immediate humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people, both civilian
and military.
1. Resisting any attempts to diplomatically coerce the Ukrainians
into capitulating their sovereignty and territorial integrity,
including Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
1. Continuing harsh personal sanctions against Russian Dictator
Vladimir Putin and all Russian oligarchs.

The goal of these actions is to weaken Russian aggression and
expansionism, promote peace, and save countless human lives by
supporting actions to help end the war quickly and decisively.

I also want to say that I understand there is a lot of concern
about escalating the conflict into a nuclear war with Russia, as
both the United States and Russia are nuclear powers. That said,
in only one week Russia has threatened the integrity of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster site and, on Mar 3, 2022, has attacked
the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a fire breaking
out. While the threat of nuclear war is very real, that will
matter little if either or both of these sites turn into an
equally devastating nuclear disaster.

Dear \<**<u>representative</u>**\>:

I am a voter in \<**<u>state / district</u>**\>. I am reaching out to you today
because of a deep concern for the security situation in Eastern
Europe. As you are well aware Russia has been militarily
threatening Ukrainian sovereignty since 2014, and escalated that
conflict on Feb 24, 2022. These Russian actions also militarily
threaten Poland, the Baltic states, and nations in the Black Sea
region; all of which are members of NATO. This will bring about a
new war in Europe and will inevitably end up involving our
American soldiers. We are asking you to stand firm against Russian
expansionism.

As of today, there have been several attacks on various regions of
Ukraine resulting in many deaths, including those of innocent
civilians - among them children. Furthermore, there has been
sufficient evidence that the Russian and the Belarusian militaries
have used prohibited weapons, such as cluster munitions and
thermobaric bombs. 

To help secure peace, freedom, and democracy in Europe, we ask
you, \<**<u>representative</u>**\>, to take the following steps:

1. Send immediate emergency military aid to Ukraine including air
defense, antitank, anti-ship, anti-aircraft, and electronic
warfare systems.
1. Send immediate humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people, both
civilian and military.
1. Resist any attempts to diplomatically coerce the Ukrainians into
capitulating their sovereignty and territorial integrity,
including in Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
1. Continue to impose harsh personal sanctions against Russian
Dictator Vladimir Putin and all Russian oligarchs.

The goal of the above actions is to weaken Russian aggression and
expansionism, promote peace, and save countless human lives by
supporting actions to help end the war quickly and decisively.

Ultimately, there is a lot of concern about escalating the
conflict into a nuclear war with Russia, as both the United States
and Russia are nuclear powers. That said, in only one week, Russia
has threatened the integrity of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster
site and, on Mar 3, 2022, has attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant, resulting in a fire breaking out. While the threat of
nuclear war is very real, that will matter little if either or
both of these sites turns into an equally devastating nuclear
disaster.

Sincerely,

\<**<u>Your Name</u>**\>

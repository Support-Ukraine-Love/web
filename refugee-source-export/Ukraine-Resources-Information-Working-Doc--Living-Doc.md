# **10. Women & Children_ _**



* "What should parents expect from their children while in the shelter? How should they support them?

    There should be books, games and computers there for children to use. But in a state of hyper-alertness, a lot of children find it difficult to concentrate or do anything apart from cry. If this happens, hold and comfort the child. Don’t tell them to stop being afraid. This isn’t helpful — it dismisses what they are feeling. Rather, acknowledge that it is a scary situation and reassure them that you are with them and things will be okay.


    Then after the alert has passed, go to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PmBYdfv5RSk) for breathing exercises, music, and movement exercises to “shake out the fear” and reduce levels of tension. This is a very worthwhile thing to do."

* [NBU | Fundraising Account for Humanitarian Assistance to Ukrainians Affected by Russia’s Aggression](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-rahunok-dlya-gumanitarnoyi-dopomogi-ukrayintsyam-postrajdalim-vid-rosiyskoyi-agresiyi): "The account is meant for charity contributions from Ukraine and from abroad. The Ministry of Social Policy will channel the raised funds to support Ukraine’s citizens severely affected by the war."
* "Money transferred to this account will be used by the [Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine](https://www.msp.gov.ua/en/):
    * to provide food and shelter for refugees and citizens that have been displaced due to military conflict;
    * to provide clothing, shoes, and medicine for them;
    * to buy staple goods for the population;
    * to pay out one-off financial aid and to meet other essential needs of the population."
* [CNBC | Here’s a list of the top-rated charities to help the Ukraine relief effort](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/heres-a-list-of-top-rated-charities-to-help-the-ukraine-relief-effort.html): "To make sure your money gets into the right hands, here is a list of highly rated nonprofits engaged in relief and recovery efforts in Ukraine and the surrounding areas."  This is an excellent list, organized by donation category/charity activity, that links directly to the Nonprofit Organization's 'Charity Navigator' profile - which shows you their rating. 


## **~Charity Verification**



* On the [I.R.S. website](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/tax-exempt-organization-search), you can search to see if your organization is listed as a 501(c)3. Make sure the charity is an actual charity. (To claim your donation as a deduction, the organization must have this status.)
* [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/): When choosing a charity, look for one that spends less than 30% of its total costs on administration and fundraising expenses. 
* [Guidestar.org](https://www.guidestar.org/): You can learn more about the charity and their rating. A good rule of thumb is to stick with charities with a rating of 3 stars and above. 
* You can review complaints about charities at [Give.org](https://give.org/), the BBB Wise Giving Alliance.
* Search the charity register for the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information). *There are different registers for charities in [Scotland](https://www.oscr.org.uk/search) and charities in [Northern Ireland](https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/?pageNumber=1).
* We recommend that you check out the social pages of organizations you are thinking of donating to. Many smaller orgs post _how_ _they are using donations_ and provide some element of verification. Transparency is paramount.
